playfair cipher decryption/encryption program

The program uses an alphabet of every letter and number to make a 6x6 matrix playfair cipher

When running the program, the user inputs a key that will be used until the program stops

There are 5 options in the main loop:
	encipher -- enter a string to be enciphered 
	decipher -- enter a string to be deciphered
	encipher from file -- enciphers the text in "encipher.txt" and writes the result to "output.txt"
	decipher from file -- deciphers the text in "decipher.txt" and writes the result to "output.txt"
	quit -- end the program
	
the program is demoed via typescript in 'demo'

encipher.txt is the text from the difficult substitution cipher, decipher.txt is the encryption of that text using the key 'tomato', and output.txt is the decryption (the original text again)
